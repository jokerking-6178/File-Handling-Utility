# Description of Project 

I've created a comprehensive explanation of every feature and method used in the File Handling Utility program. The explanation is organized into 15 main sections covering:
Key Areas Covered:

Imports & Dependencies - Why each import was chosen
Class Structure - Static variables and their purposes
Main Method - Program flow and control structures
User Interface Methods - Menu system and input handling
Directory Management - Creating and managing directories
File Creation & Writing - Multiple approaches to file writing
File Reading - Reading files with line numbers and formatting
File Modification - Four different modification techniques
File Appending - Adding content to existing files
File Listing - Advanced directory operations with streams
File Deletion - Safe deletion with user confirmation
Error Handling - Comprehensive exception management
Modern Java Features - NIO.2 advantages over legacy I/O
Programming Best Practices - Code quality principles
Stream Operations - Modern functional programming features

Technical Highlights:

NIO.2 Package Usage: Modern file operations vs legacy I/O
Stream Processing: Filtering and collecting directory contents
Exception Handling: Multiple exception types and patterns
User Input Validation: Robust input checking and sanitization
Memory Efficiency: Using appropriate data structures
Error Recovery: Graceful handling of edge cases

Each section includes code examples, explanations of why specific approaches were chosen, and the benefits of using modern Java features. This should give you a complete understanding of how every part of the program works and the reasoning behind each implementation choice.
